The source file requires Colorama. If you don't have it, make sure to install it.

To run on Windows it's more likely you'll need the new terminal, as it is ANSI.

What is this app?
----------

Made with Python, guy88-todo is a CLI task manager based on the UNIX / GNU + Linux tool, fdisk. It's controlled with certain commands.
- h: Display help list
- n: Make a new task
- d: Delete task
- s: Show all the tasks you have
- c: Mark a task as complete
- i: Mark a task as incomplete
- q / CTRL + C: Leave the app

To make new tasks you have to specify label, date, ID and, if you wish some notes so you know what to do.

To delete, complete and uncomplete tasks you have to specify its ID, so make sure to use numbers!

This was a little fun project I had in mind, but it works for those enthusiasts that don't like GUI task managers and want to get ahold of something else, apart of making it a usable tool in daily life :D
